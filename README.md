# Grouped Node Chart

I've been growing tired of using charts to display categorical data. I was inspired by the work of Nathatn http://flowingdata.com/2017/09/11/most-female-and-male-occupations-since-1950/ to start building interactive node charts to display breakdowns in categorical data instead.

Much of the code was forked and adapted from from Jim Vallandingham at:http://vallandingham.me/gates_bubbles/

I was also inspired by Mike Bostock's clustered node charts: https://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/7881887

All data used in this example is simulated.
